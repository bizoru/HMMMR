# HMMMR
Heterogenous model for massive multilinear regressions

## Requirements

This needs a version >= 0.5.2 of scikit cuda, currently the version on Pypi is 0.5.1, that's why we need to build it from github.
This last version includes cusolver wrappers in order to do matrix inversion.


pip install git+https://github.com/lebedov/scikit-cuda
